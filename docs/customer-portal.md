# Customer Portal (`/customer`)

Phase 1 — 2026-06-24. External customers get a login to track their equipment,
build & shipping status, warranty, and support. Branded to IAT. The admin
**Customers** front door (customer-first provisioning) was added 2026-06-25.

## Who it's for
One login per customer **company** (`profiles.role = 'customer'`, linked via
`profiles.customer_id`). A login sees every unit linked to that company.

## Data model (migration 026_customer_portal.sql)
- `customers` — one row per customer company (name, contact, phone, location; `status`
  active/inactive; nullable `logo_url` / `accent_color` reserved for future white-label).
- `profiles.customer_id` — links a login to its company; `profiles.role` now allows `'customer'`.
- `equipment.customer_id` — links each unit to its owning customer.
- `equipment_milestones` — the staff-updated build→ship timeline shown on the portal.

All four are **service-role only** (RLS on, no policies). The `/customer` pages run
server-side and fetch only the logged-in customer's rows (`lib/customer-auth.ts` →
`getCustomerUser`), so the browser never queries these tables and one customer can never
read another's data — same posture as `/admin`.

## Self-serve access requests (2026-07-01)
A third entry point, for customers who aren't in `/admin/customers` yet: from
`/support`, after submitting an equipment ticket (or later, from a successful
`/support/status` lookup), an anonymous submitter sees a **"Request portal
access"** button (`components/support/RequestAccountCta.tsx`, shared by both
call sites) — opt-in, never forced. It re-proves ownership with the same
ticket-number + email match the status lookup uses (`POST
/api/tickets/request-account`), and is suppressed once the ticket is already
linked to an account, or shows a "pending" state if a request is already
awaiting review. Requests land in a new **pending queue**, not an
auto-created account:
- `customer_portal_requests` (migration `034`) — one row per request, snapshot
  of the requester's details off the ticket (not client input), a
  `suggested_customer_id` signal (set when the ticket's equipment serial is
  already linked to an existing customer — flags a likely second-contact
  case), and `pending | approved | denied` status. Service-role only, same
  posture as `customers`.
- **`/admin/customers` → Requests tab** (`CustomerRequestsQueue.tsx`) — pending
  count badge alongside All/Active/Inactive, each row linking back to the
  originating ticket. **Approve** opens `NewCustomerWizard` pre-filled from the
  request (reuses the exact same invite pipeline below — no parallel logic);
  if a suggested match exists, a banner offers **"attach to this company
  instead"** rather than creating a duplicate. **Deny** just closes the request
  out (optional reason, no email sent).
- Approving stamps `tickets.customer_id` (migration `034`) onto the
  triggering ticket **and backfills** any other historical ticket from the
  same email that isn't linked yet — additive to `POST
  /api/admin/customers/invite` (`link_ticket_id` / `link_request_id` params),
  not a separate code path. Both the `/customer` dashboard and the
  `/admin/customers/[id]` request count now match on `customer_id OR
  email OR serial` (previously email/serial only), so a second contact at the
  same company (different login email) is no longer invisible to either view.
  `troubleshooting_intakes` is untouched (historical-only since migration 027).

## Provisioning (admin)
Two entry points, **one** backend (`POST /api/admin/customers/invite` — creates/links the
customer + equipment, seeds the tracker, and emails the invite):

**Customer-first — `/admin/customers` → New Customer** (the front door):
1. **Scan a Submittal PDF** — the browser uploads the file straight to a private
   `admin-submittals` Storage bucket via a signed upload URL (`POST
   /api/admin/customers/submittal-upload`, migration `035`), then `POST
   /api/admin/customers/extract-submittal` downloads it server-side and Claude
   extracts the customer **and** unit fields. Review/edit before sending. (Fixed
   2026-07-01: the file used to ride in the request body as base64 and silently
   413'd on Vercel's ~4.5MB function limit for anything over ~3MB, regardless of
   the route's own — much higher — size check; real Submittals routinely exceed
   that. The uploaded file is deleted right after extraction.)
2. **Create account & send invite** — creates the `customers` row, the auth login
   (`role='customer'` + `customer_id`), the `equipment` row (upsert by serial — links if it
   already exists), seeds the build/ship tracker, and emails a temp password + Sign In link.
   The dialog also shows the temp password to hand off if email delivery isn't set up.

> ⚠️ **The invite also creates an `employees` row — as a side effect nobody asked for.**
> `handle_new_user()` (migration 001) fires on every `auth.users` insert, so
> `auth.admin.createUser()` above trips it. The route then sets `profiles.role='customer'`,
> but the employees row it just caused stays, defaulted to `is_active=true` /
> `org_visible=true`. So **every customer is in the `employees` table**, and any surface
> that reads `employees` as a staff roster must exclude them via `getCustomerIds()` in
> `lib/staff.ts`. Until 2026-07-16 nothing did, and 4 of the 12 nodes on the live org chart
> and employee directory were customers rendered as staff with mailto: cards. Deleting the
> row is **not** the fix (it would cascade oddly and the next invite recreates it) — the
> filter is. If you add a new page or picker that lists `employees`, filter it there too.

The same wizard (`components/admin/NewCustomerWizard.tsx`) is the equipment list's
**"New from Submittal"** button.

**Equipment-first — `/admin/equipment/[id]` → Customer Portal card → Invite to portal:**
links *this* existing unit to a new/existing customer (same backend, `equipment_id` path).

Staff advance the tracker from the **Build & Shipping** card
(`POST` seeds defaults, `PATCH` updates a milestone — `/api/admin/equipment/[id]/milestones`).
Each step offers one-click **canned note presets** (`lib/customer.ts` → `notePresetsFor`,
customer-facing wording) alongside a free-text note. On the customer dashboard the timeline renders
as a **winding-road roadmap** — milestone "stops" along a road that snakes through the card, with a
truck parked at the current stop (`components/customer/CustomerDashboard.tsx`).

## Managing customers (admin)
- **`/admin/customers`** — searchable list (Company / Contact / Location / Units / Status),
  Active/Inactive filters.
- **`/admin/customers/[id]`** — contact details + linked units, and two actions:
  - **Resend invite** (`POST …/resend-invite`) — resets the temp password, re-sends the email,
    re-activates the account.
  - **Remove from portal** (`POST …/remove`) — deletes the login so they can't sign in and marks
    the customer **inactive**; the company + its equipment + history are kept (re-invite to restore).
  Both are audited (`customer.resend_invite`, `customer.remove`).

## Authentication note
No magic/recovery link: admin-generated links use Supabase's implicit flow and need each redirect
origin allowlisted, which is brittle across preview/prod. Instead the invite emails a **temp
password**; first sign-in is gated by `/customer/welcome`, which forces the customer to set their
own password. Mirrors the employee invite flow. The login link uses the request's origin, so a
preview invite points at the preview and a prod invite at prod.

## Customer experience
- Invite email → **Sign In** at `/login` with the temp password → `/customer/welcome` forces a new
  password → `/customer`.
- Dashboard: unit cards (serial / model / warranty), build & shipping tracker, **build & QC
  photos** (admin-uploaded, expandable gallery), KB + start-up guide, the support forms, a
  **Contact Us** card (IAT team roster + a message form that emails the team), and "My Requests"
  (their tickets + troubleshooting intakes).
- **Photos** come from the admin equipment record (`/admin/equipment/[id]` → Photos card →
  Upload). Files go browser → Supabase Storage (`ticket-photos` bucket) → `equipment.photo_urls`.
- **Contact Us** form → `POST /api/customer/contact` → emails the IAT team
  (`jacob.younker@dehumidifiers.com`); the customer's identity is taken from the session.
- **Jerry** (IAT's customer assistant, right rail) → `POST /api/customer/assistant` (Anthropic `claude-sonnet-4-6`) —
  presented as an animated "presence" (a breathing orb that energizes while it reads the docs) with
  typeset answers + cited source chips, not a chat-bubble bot (orb styles in `app/globals.css`).
  The system prompt introduces him by name ("You are Jerry…").
  Read-only Q&A grounded in the customer's equipment **and IAT's documentation (RAG, migration 030)**:
  it retrieves the most relevant manual/datasheet excerpts, answers **only** from them, and **cites the
  source (document + page)** as chips under each answer — or says it's not in the documentation and
  routes to the support forms / Contact Us. It cannot take actions. Uses the existing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  (no new vendor — Postgres full-text search). See **docs/kb-rag-assistant.md**.
- **Support-form prefill:** when a signed-in customer opens `/support/equipment-support`, their
  account email + contact details prefill and a "Your account & equipment" card lets them pick a
  unit (fills serial / model / voltage; all editable). `/support` stays public — anonymous visitors
  see the unchanged form. `lib/support-context.ts` → `getSupportCustomerContext`, passed in by the
  session-aware `app/support/[form]/page.tsx` (now rendered per-request).
- **Status-lookup prefill:** signed-in customers get their email prefilled on `/support/status`
  plus a "Your requests" one-tap picker (`getStatusCustomerContext`; server `page.tsx` +
  `StatusClient.tsx`). Anonymous lookup unchanged.
- **Theme** — a light/dark toggle (Sun/Moon, `components/ThemeToggle.tsx`) sits in the header. The
  customer portal is **light-first**: a browser that has never picked a theme defaults to light
  (scoped effect in `CustomerDashboard`; admin/employee keep the global `system` default), and a
  customer who toggles to dark is remembered.
- Future log-ins: `/login` with their email + password (middleware routes them to `/customer`).

## Ops / deploy notes
- Apply `supabase/migrations/026_customer_portal.sql` (done 2026-06-24). The admin front door
  added 2026-06-25 needs **no migration**.
- **Self-serve access requests (2026-07-01):** apply `supabase/migrations/034_customer_portal_requests.sql`
  (done — `customer_portal_requests` table + `tickets.customer_id`) before the "Request portal
  access" CTA will work; the frontend degrades gracefully (clean "not found" response, no crash)
  if it's deployed before the migration runs.
- **Documentation RAG (2026-06-29):** apply `supabase/migrations/030_kb_rag.sql`, then load the pool
  with `node scripts/ingest-kb-docs.mjs` — see **docs/kb-rag-assistant.md**. No new env vars.
- Customer email sends from `onboarding@resend.dev` until a Resend domain is verified —
  delivery is limited; use the temp password shown in the invite/resend dialog meanwhile.
- No new env vars.
- **Deleting a `customers` row orphans its logins** (`profiles.customer_id` is `ON DELETE SET NULL`).
  An orphaned customer login can't resolve a portal account; `/customer` signs it out to `/login`
  instead of looping. Find orphans: `SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE role='customer' AND customer_id IS NULL;`

## Deferred (later phases)
- Parts & PM support forms (still disabled on `/support`).
- Pre-filling the support forms with the customer's unit.
- Per-customer white-label (the `logo_url` / `accent_color` columns already exist).
- "Rep vs D2C" provenance flag on the customer (deferred pending review).
